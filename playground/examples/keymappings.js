# Key mappings
   
This tutorial-that-is-not-really-a-tutorial
just lists all the various keystroke mappings
in gibber and provides explanations as needed.
In macOS, replace any `Alt` keys with `Option`.

## Running Code 
(also see running/stopping code tutorial)

- run current line or selection at start of next measure = `Ctrl+Enter`
- run current line or selection immediately = `Shift+Enter`
- run "block" of code at start of next measure = `Alt+Enter`
- run "block" of code immediately = `Shift+Alt+Enter`

## Clearing Audiovisuals
- clear = `Ctrl+.` OR `Shift+Ctrl+.`

(on some keyboards `Ctrl+.` might not work... in this case
try `Ctrl+Shift+.`)

## Console 
(also see using the console tutorial)

- open the console (this is a browser shortcut, not gibber specific)

| platform |       chrome/edge       |        firefox          |
| ------   | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
|win/lin   |   `ctrl + shift + j`    |    `ctrl + shift + i`   |
|mac       | `command + option + j`  |  `command + option + i` |

- clear the console = `Ctrl+\`

## Saving & Loading Preload Code 
preload code runs as soon as gibber loads. it's a good
way to initialize small scripts / preferences etc.

- Save new preload code = `Shift+Ctrl+s`
- Load preload code into editor for editing = `Shift+Ctrl+l`

## Editor Font Size
These only affect the text editor, not the top menu bar.
- Bigger = `Ctrl+=`
- Smaller = `Ctrl+-`

## Marching.js Camera
- Toggle Camera Control = `Ctrl+Shift+C`

When camera control is enabled, use the following
keys to navigate the 3D scene:

- `wasd` = move in four directions
- `arrow keys` = turn in four directions
- `alt` = move / turn faster while holding this down

## Misc 
- hide code and top bar  = `Ctrl + h`
- toggle code background (when using graphics) = `Ctrl + Alt + b`
